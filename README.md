# meme-generator

A vanilla JavaScript project utilizing [`HTML <canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

During this sprint, in order to bulk rename the template images, I used [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) for the first time (since I preferred learning a new skill rather than manually renaming 20+ files)

Styling could be better but I prefered adding extra functionality such as saving in different formats (png, jpeg and webp which was not supported in [Mozzila Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) back then), multiple draggable text boxes.
